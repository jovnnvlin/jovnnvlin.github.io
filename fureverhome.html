        <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
        <p>This was a project for IAT 334: Interface Design, made in Summer 2023. With a team of 3 other group mates, we were tasked with conceptualizing, creating and prototyping an app. After conducting research and interviews, we decided on a pet care app for rescued dogs.</p>
        <p>Roles were split quite evenly, we all worked on ideation, research, slide designs, presentations, and prototyping. I took on editing the video and doing the voiceover.</p>
        <p>FurEverHome is a mobile application dedicated to support pet owners with rescued dogs, that aims to create a nurturing environment for both the owner and pet. The goal is to ensure that every rescued animal receives the love, care, and attention they deserve.</p>
        <h4>App Features</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Daily health check-in to keep track of the health and â€¨well-being of the pets</li>
            <li>Community forum for users to connect and seek advice on various aspects of pet care with a live chat to connect with volunteers</li>
            <li>A resources page with articles covering topics such as fostering guides for new pet owners and the process of surrendering animals</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Stage 1: Proposal</h4>
        <p>In the first phase of our project we had to come up with ideas for apps and narrow down those ideas into our top 3. We used the Figjam to note down all ideas and vote on which ones were the most viable. We had to consider what the design domain or category of app we wanted to design for, who our target audience would be, what are the goals of our target user, and what challenges and activities these users have. We settled on 3 ideas that we presented:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pet Care For Rescued Animal</li>
            <li>Endangered Animals Education</li>
            <li>Pet Rescue from Other Countries</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Stage 2: Idea and Interaction Framework</h4>

        <p>In the second phase, we settled on the concept we liked the most, pet care for rescued animals. We conducted additional research by interviewing 7 people, some who adopted from breeders, 2 who adopted rescues and one who also volunteers for the SPCA.</p>

        <h4>Stage 3: Prototyping the Interaction</h4>
        <p>This is the stage where we started prototyping the app with low fidelity mockups . Since we had three different app views for 3 different types of users, I was responsible for the volunteer wire-flow and prototype.</p>

        <h4>Stage 4: Interactive Mockup</h4>
        <p>This is the stage where I finished creating the high fidelity mockup and prototype for the volunteer user.</p>
        
        <h4>Final Stage: Final Showcase and Video</h4>
        <p>For the final presentation, in addition to assisting with the presentation deck design, I edited, and did the voiceover for the pitch video.</p>

        <h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
        <p>I think the biggest challenges of this project was conceptualizing and developing an app that was unique and useful. There are so many existing apps for all types of use cases. We needed to make sure we created an app that was different than what already exists and meets the needs of our target users and creates solutions for the problems we researched. We had to make sure our app was easy and satisfying to use, and this was done by doing user-testing and implementing feedback.</p>

        <h3 id="reflect">Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            I thoroughly enjoyed the user interface and prototyping aspects of this project. It sparked a greater interest in UI/UX and product design in me. Grade-wise the project received an 86.25% which would be an A-. Overall I think this project was a success.
